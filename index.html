  <section id="courses">
    <h2>Courses & Learning</h2>
    <div class="course">
      <h3>Programming Basics & Dynamic Memory</h3>
      <p>This section introduced me to fundamental programming concepts such as primitive data types, variables, control structures, and functions. I also learned about pointers and dynamic memory allocation, which are essential in C programming. Understanding how to manage memory efficiently can lead to significant improvements in application performance, especially in environments with limited resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course">
      <h3>Big O Notation and Complexity</h3>
      <p>Learning algorithmic complexity taught me the importance of efficiency. Big O notation helps in estimating the performance of an algorithm relative to the size of the input. It provides a high-level understanding of how algorithms scale and allows for comparing different algorithms based on their time and space requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course">
      <h3>List Structures (Linked Lists)</h3>
      <p>In this section, I learned about linked lists, a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes connected through pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course">
      <h3>Stacks and Queues</h3>
      <p>Stacks and queues are essential data structures that represent collections of elements with specific access rules. Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while queues operate on a First In, First Out (FIFO) basis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course">
      <h3>Trees and Hashing</h3>
      <p>Trees are hierarchical data structures that allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Hashing provides a way to efficiently map keys to values, enabling constant time complexity for lookups in average cases.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>DSA Problem-Solving Workflow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem Analysis:</strong> Read and analyze the problem statement, identify input/output requirements, and constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Choosing Data Structures:</strong> Select the most efficient data structure for the problem (e.g., arrays, stacks, graphs).</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithm Design:</strong> Design an algorithm based on patterns, previous experience, or standard approaches (e.g., divide-and-conquer).</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Code the solution with an emphasis on readability, modularity, and test cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimization & Testing:</strong> Optimize the solution for time and space complexity and test it against edge cases.</li>
    </ul>
